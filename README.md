# Inputing-Integer-in-python
Here we will use input as integer\
All inputs in Python are by default assumed to be strings.\
But if we want to input an integer from the user, we will have to explicitly tell Python to convert the input string to an int.
So we write "int(input())" instead of just "input()".

# Example in main.py

The example is of "Finding are of Rectangle"

# Write a program which does the following

* Take input from the console and store it in the variables l and b Take input from the console and store it in the variables
* Compute the area of the rectangle and store it in the variable a
* Output the following string to the console - "Area of the given rectangle is a"
